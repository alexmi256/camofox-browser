# Third-Party Notices

The portable Windows distribution redistributes the following runtime components in addition to camofox-browser itself.

## Node.js v22.23.2

- Project: https://nodejs.org/
- Source: https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/v22.23.2
- License: MIT, with additional third-party notices included by the upstream Node.js distribution.
- The upstream `LICENSE` file is retained in the portable bundle under `node/LICENSE`.

## Camoufox v152.0.4-beta.28

- Project: https://github.com/daijro/camoufox
- Source: https://github.com/daijro/camoufox/tree/v152.0.4-beta.28
- License: Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0).
- The portable bundle redistributes the Windows x64 browser/runtime from the exact upstream release, with the upstream `fonts/` directory deliberately removed.
- The exact upstream tag states that its Windows/macOS bundled fonts are copyrighted and are not intended or permitted for redistribution. Those fonts are therefore not included in this portable distribution; Windows uses the fonts installed on the host system.
- The exact Camoufox MPL-2.0 text is retained at `licenses/Camoufox-MPL-2.0.txt`, and the corresponding source is available from the exact source tag above.

## camoufox-js 0.8.5

- License: Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0).

## playwright-core 1.59.1 / VS Code Codicon assets

- Project: https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/tree/v1.59.1
- `playwright-core` is Apache-2.0 and retains its upstream `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and `ThirdPartyNotices.txt` under `app/node_modules/playwright-core/`.
- Playwright's bundled Codicon font assets originate from its `packages/web/src/third_party/vscode/` source directory and are covered there by the MIT License, Copyright (c) 2015 - present Microsoft Corporation.
- The exact upstream MIT license text for those Codicon assets is retained at `licenses/Playwright-VSCode-Codicon-MIT.txt`.

The Mozilla Public License 2.0 text used by `camoufox-js` is retained at `licenses/MPL-2.0.txt`. The Camoufox executable and browser runtime correspond to upstream `v152.0.4-beta.28`, except for the excluded `fonts/` payload described above.

## Other npm runtime dependencies

Production npm dependencies are installed from the repository lockfile with their package metadata and license files preserved under `app/node_modules/`. Refer to each package's included `package.json` and license file for its applicable terms.

camoufox-browser itself is licensed under the MIT License; see `app/LICENSE` in the portable bundle.
